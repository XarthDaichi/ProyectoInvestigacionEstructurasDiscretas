abstract = {This article addresses the online exact string matching problem which consists in finding all occurrences of a given pattern p in a text t . It is an extensively studied problem in computer science, mainly due to its direct applications to such diverse areas as text, image and signal processing, speech analysis and recognition, information retrieval, data compression, computational biology and chemistry.
In the last decade more than 50 new algorithms have been proposed for the problem, which add up to a wide set of (almost 40) algorithms presented before 2000. In this article we review the string matching algorithms presented in the last decade and present experimental results in order to bring order among the dozens of articles published in this area.},

issn = {2169-3536},
abstract = {String matching has been an extensively studied research domain in the past two decades due to its various applications in the fields of text, image, signal, and speech processing. As a result, choosing an appropriate string matching algorithm for current applications and addressing challenges is difficult. Understanding different string matching approaches (such as exact string matching and approximate string matching algorithms), integrating several algorithms, and modifying algorithms to address related issues are also difficult. This paper presents a survey on single-pattern exact string matching algorithms. The main purpose of this survey is to propose new classification, identify new directions and highlight the possible challenges, current trends, and future works in the area of string matching algorithms with a core focus on exact string matching algorithms.},
